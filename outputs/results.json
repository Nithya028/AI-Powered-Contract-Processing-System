    "summary": "This Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) was entered into on **April 5, 2025**, between **Orion Data Systems Pvt. Ltd.** and **InnovEdge Analytics**. Its primary purpose is the mutual protection of confidential business information, including proprietary data, trade secrets, and strategic information shared between the parties.\n\nBoth parties are obligated to keep this information confidential and refrain from disclosing it to third parties. Information already public or known prior to disclosure is explicitly excluded from this definition. The NDA has a **term of two years** from the effective date, implying automatic termination thereafter. **Payment obligations are not specified** within the contract.\n\nThe agreement is governed by **Indian law**, specifically under the jurisdiction of Hyderabad. A **non-standard or risky omission** is the absence of clauses detailing specific remedies for breach, or requirements for the return or destruction of confidential information upon the agreement's termination. Furthermore, there are no provisions for early termination before the two-year term concludes."
